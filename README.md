# Eyes

## Description

In this project, the eyes will track and follow in unison the cursor anywhere on the browser window. The eyes were created with CSS and JavaScript was used to track the cursor.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

The eyes begin to track upon opening of the web browser window. There are not any additional instructions or steps for the user in order to run this program.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include modifying the JavaScript for the eyes to track in the very middle of the browser window to look cross eyed.
